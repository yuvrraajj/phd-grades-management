## ASSISTANT
Building a web-based task management system for Ph.D. grades as described involves multiple steps, spanning from the initial setup to deploying the final application. This system involves several components: authentication (with specific role-based access), data entry for grades, approval workflows, and the ability to download grade reports. Let's break down the process into key stages for a detailed understanding.

### 1. **Project Planning and Setup**

- **Technology Stack**: Decide on the technology stack. For a web application like this, you could use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for a JavaScript/TypeScript-based stack, or the Django framework (Python) which is great for rapid development and comes with an admin panel out-of-the-box.
- **Database Design**: Design your database schema based on the entities you've described (e.g., `USERS_DETAILS`, `USER_ROLES`, `phdgrade`). For relational databases, consider PostgreSQL or MySQL. For NoSQL, MongoDB is a good choice.

### 2. **Development Environment Setup**

- Install Node.js, Python, or any other runtime environment based on your stack.
- Setup your development IDE (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.).
- Initialize your project repository using Git for version control.

### 3. **Backend Development**

- **Authentication**: Implement OAuth2 with Google for Gmail-based login. Libraries like Passport.js (for Node.js) or django-allauth (for Django) can simplify this.
- **API Development**: Create RESTful APIs or GraphQL for handling CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for your data entities.
- **Database Integration**: Implement models for your database and integrate them with your APIs. Ensure role-based access control is enforced at this layer.
- **Email Functionality**: Use nodemailer (for Node.js) or Django’s email backend for sending emails to PhD students upon grade approval.

### 4. **Frontend Development**

- **Framework Setup**: React.js or Angular for SPA (Single Page Application) setups are popular choices. Django templates can be used if you're going with Django.
- **Pages and Components**: Develop the UI components based on the screens mentioned (login, grade input, approval list, grade download).
- **State Management**: For complex state management (especially with roles and authentication), consider using Redux (with React) or NgRx (with Angular).
- **Integration with Backend**: Use Axios or Fetch API to connect your frontend with the backend services.

### 5. **Testing**

- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for both backend and frontend logic. Jest is a popular choice for JavaScript.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the integration points between your frontend, backend, and database.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Tools like Cypress or Selenium can be used to simulate user flows through the application.

### 6. **Deployment**

- **Server Setup**: AWS EC2 instances, Google Cloud Compute Engine, or Heroku are good options for deploying web applications.
- **CI/CD**: Setup continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins.
- **Domain and SSL**: Purchase a domain name and set up SSL for HTTPS through services like Let’s Encrypt.

### 7. **Maintenance and Upgrades**

- **Bug Fixes**: Regularly update the application based on user feedback.
- **Security Updates**: Keep your libraries and frameworks up to date to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

### Example Code Snippet for User Authentication (Backend with Node.js and Passport.js)

Here's a basic example to give you a sense of how you might start implementing Gmail authentication in a Node.js application:

```javascript
const passport = require('passport');
const GoogleStrategy = require('passport-google-oauth20').Strategy;

passport.use(new GoogleStrategy({
    clientID: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    callbackURL: "/auth/google/callback"
  },
  function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, cb) {
    // Here, you would find or create a user in your database
    // Check roles from your USER_ROLES table and proceed accordingly
    return cb(null, profile);
  }
));

// Express route to start the authentication process
app.get('/auth/google',
  passport.authenticate('google', { scope: ['profile', 'email'] }));

// Callback route once Google has authenticated the user
app.get('/auth/google/callback', 
  passport.authenticate('google', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
  function(req, res) {
    // Successful authentication, redirect to dashboard.
    res.redirect('/dashboard');
  });
```

This code demonstrates how to set up Google authentication with Passport.js. Remember, you’ll need to handle the database checks (e.g., `USERS_DETAILS`, `USER_ROLES`) after retrieving the user profile from Google.

The project you're embarking on will be both challenging and rewarding, offering a comprehensive experience in web development. This overview should help guide

## USER
How to do this?

## ASSISTANT
To build your project using the Django framework, focusing on rapid development with a built-in admin panel for managing user roles and handling data entry for Ph.D. grades, you’ll need to follow several steps. Django is a powerful framework for web development with Python, providing a structured environment with lots of built-in functionalities, such as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), authentication, and an admin interface. Here’s how you can proceed:

### 1. **Environment Setup**

- **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.
- **Virtual Environment**: It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for your Python projects to manage dependencies efficiently.
  ```bash
  python -m venv myenv
  source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
  ```
- **Install Django**: With your virtual environment activated, install Django using pip.
  ```bash
  pip install django
  ```

### 2. **Start Your Project**

- **Create a Django Project**: Use the `django-admin` command to create a new Django project.
  ```bash
  django-admin startproject myproject
  cd myproject
  ```
- **Start an App**: In Django, your project can consist of multiple apps. Start your first app.
  ```bash
  python manage.py startapp grades
  ```

### 3. **Setup Database Models**

- **Define Models**: Inside your app (e.g., `grades`), define models in `models.py` that reflect your database schema, such as `UserDetails`, `UserRoles`, and `PhdGrade`.
  ```python
  from django.db import models
  from django.contrib.auth.models import User

  class UserRoles(models.Model):
      user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
      role = models.CharField(max_length=100)

  class PhdGrade(models.Model):
      student = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='grades')
      tp_pls_grade = models.CharField(max_length=50)
      seminar_grade = models.CharField(max_length=50)
      thesis_grade = models.CharField(max_length=50)
      supervisor_signature = models.BooleanField(default=False)
      hod_signature = models.BooleanField(default=False)
  ```
- **Migrate Database**: After defining your models, generate and apply migrations to create your database schema.
  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

### 4. **Admin Panel Setup**

- **Create Superuser**: To access the admin panel, you'll need a superuser account.
  ```bash
  python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```
- **Register Models**: In your app's `admin.py`, register your models to make them accessible through the admin interface.
  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from .models import UserRoles, PhdGrade

  admin.site.register(UserRoles)
  admin.site.register(PhdGrade)
  ```

### 5. **Implementing Authentication and Business Logic**

- **Authentication**: For Gmail authentication, you can use `django-allauth`.
  - Install `django-allauth` using pip and configure it in your `settings.py` following the [official documentation](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
- **Views and Templates**: Implement your business logic in views (in `views.py`) and create templates for your web pages.
  - Use Django’s authentication system to manage user sessions and permissions.

### 6. **Email Setup**

- **Configure Email**: Set up email sending capabilities by configuring the email backend in `settings.py` with your SMTP provider details.
  ```python
  EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
  EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
  EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
  EMAIL_PORT = 587
  EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'yourgmail@gmail.com'
  EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'yourpassword'
  ```

### 7. **Running Your Project**

- **Run Server**: Use the following command to run your Django project. It will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

### 8. **Next Steps**

- **Implement OAuth2 for Google Login**: If you’re using `django-allauth`, configure it for Google authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Customize your views and templates to show/hide features based on the user’s role.
- **PDF Generation**: For generating PDF reports, consider using libraries like ReportLab or WeasyPrint in your view functions.
- **Testing and Deployment**: Write tests for your application and consider deploying it using a platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

## USER
Which things to do exactly here?

## ASSISTANT
For backend development of your web-based task management system for Ph.D. grades, focusing on Node.js and Express.js for a flexible and efficient RESTful API, Person 2's tasks would involve setting up the server, creating the API endpoints, managing the database, and handling authentication. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### **Setting Up Node.js and Express.js Environment**

1. **Initialize Node Project**: Start by creating a new directory for your project and initializing it with `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js, and other necessary libraries like `body-parser` (for parsing incoming request bodies), `cors` (to enable CORS), and `dotenv` (to manage environment variables).
   ```bash
   npm install express body-parser cors dotenv
   ```
3. **Basic Server Setup**: Create an `app.js` file to set up your basic Express server.
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
   const cors = require('cors');

   const app = express();
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

   app.use(cors());
   app.use(bodyParser.json());

   app.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

### **API Development**

1. **RESTful API Endpoints**: Define routes and controllers for your application. For example, create routes for user login, grade submission, and fetching grades.
   - **User Authentication**: `/api/auth/login`
   - **Submit Grades**: `/api/grades/submit`
   - **Fetch Grades**: `/api/grades/fetch`
2. **Controllers**: Implement logic in controllers for each endpoint, such as validating user input, interacting with the database, and returning responses to the client.

### **Database Management**

1. **Choose a Database**: Decide on a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL). For MongoDB, you might use Mongoose for object modeling.
2. **Install Database Driver**: Install the appropriate driver/package for your chosen database (e.g., `mongoose` for MongoDB).
   ```bash
   npm install mongoose
   ```
3. **Design Database Schema**: Create models for your database entities (`USERS_DETAILS`, `USER_ROLES`, `phdgrade`).
   - Example for a `UserDetail` model with Mongoose:
     ```javascript
     const mongoose = require('mongoose');

     const userDetailSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       email: String,
       name: String,
       role: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'UserRole' }
     });

     const UserDetail = mongoose.model('UserDetail', userDetailSchema);
     ```

### **Authentication with OAuth for Gmail**

1. **OAuth Setup**: Use `passport` with the `passport-google-oauth20` strategy for Gmail authentication.
   ```bash
   npm install passport passport-google-oauth20
   ```
2. **Configure Passport**: Set up passport in your application to use the Google OAuth strategy.
   ```javascript
   const passport = require('passport');
   const GoogleStrategy = require('passport-google-oauth20').Strategy;

   passport.use(new GoogleStrategy({
       clientID: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
       clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
       callbackURL: "/auth/google/callback"
     },
     function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {
       // Here, you would find or create the user in your database
       done(null, profile);
     }
   ));
   ```
3. **Authentication Routes**: Define routes for initiating the authentication process and handling the callback.
   - Example route to start authentication:
     ```javascript
     app.get('/auth/google',
       passport.authenticate('google', { scope: ['profile', 'email'] }));
     ```

### **Security Measures**

1. **Input Validation**: Use libraries like `express-validator` to validate and sanitize input data.
2. **HTTPS**: Ensure that your API is served over HTTPS. Consider using `letsencrypt` for a free SSL certificate.
3. **Environmental Variables**: Store sensitive information (like database credentials, API keys) in environment variables, not in your codebase.

### **Testing and Documentation**

- **Testing**: Write tests for your API endpoints using `mocha` and `chai`.
- **Documentation**: Document your API endpoints with tools like Swagger or Postman, providing clear instructions for frontend developers on how to consume them.

### **Collaboration**

- Use version control (Git) and regularly push your code to a shared repository.
- Communicate with the frontend developer to ensure the API meets the frontend's needs and make adjustments as necessary.

This detailed task list should guide Person 2 through setting up and developing the backend for your application within the hackathon's timeframe.

## USER
Give me an overview of what exactly to do in backend.

## ASSISTANT
For the backend development of your web-based task management system for Ph.D. grades, here's a focused overview of exactly what needs to be done, structured around Node.js and Express.js for creating a RESTful API. This backend will handle authentication, data processing, and communications with the database.

### **1. Setup Your Node.js Environment**

- **Initialize your Node.js project**: Create a new directory for your backend project and initialize it with `npm init` to create a `package.json` file that will track your dependencies.
- **Install Express.js**: Run `npm install express` to add Express to your project, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web applications.

### **2. Create Your Express Server**

- **Basic Server Setup**: In your project directory, create a file named `app.js`. Here, you will import Express and set up a basic server that listens on a port of your choice (commonly 3000 for development).
- **Middleware**: Use middleware like `body-parser` (for parsing JSON requests) and `cors` (to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) by installing them using npm and adding them to your app.

### **3. Define Routes and Controllers**

- **Routes**: Define RESTful endpoints (routes) that the frontend can call. Typical routes for your application might include:
  - Authentication (`/api/auth/login`)
  - Submitting grades (`/api/grades/submit`)
  - Viewing grades (`/api/grades/view`)
  - HOD approval (`/api/grades/approve`)
- **Controllers**: For each route, implement a controller function that handles the business logic. This could involve querying the database, processing data, and returning responses to the client.

### **4. Implement Authentication**

- **OAuth with Passport.js**: Use Passport.js with the Google OAuth 2.0 strategy to handle authentication via Gmail. You'll need to configure Passport with your Google client ID and secret, and set up routes for initiating the auth process and handling callbacks.
- **Session Management**: Implement session management to keep users logged in. Express-session is a common choice for handling sessions in Express apps.

### **5. Database Integration**

- **Choose Your Database**: Decide on a database that suits your needs (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.). Install the corresponding Node.js client (e.g., Mongoose for MongoDB, pg for PostgreSQL) in your project.
- **Define Models/Schemas**: Create models or schemas for your database entities (e.g., `User`, `Grade`, `UserRole`). These define the structure of the data you'll store.
- **Database Operations**: Implement functions to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on your database. This will include checking user roles, saving grades, and updating them upon HOD approval.

### **6. Email Notifications**

- **Setup Email Service**: Use nodemailer or a similar library to set up email notifications. You'll need to configure it with your email service provider's SMTP settings.
- **Send Emails**: Implement functionality to send emails to Ph.D. students when their grades are finalized. This involves generating email content and triggering sends at the appropriate times.

### **7. Security Best Practices**

- **Input Validation**: Use libraries like `express-validator` to validate and sanitize user input, preventing common web vulnerabilities.
- **HTTPS**: Make sure your API is served over HTTPS to protect data in transit. Use a library like `helmet` to set HTTP headers appropriately for security.

### **8. Testing**

- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Write tests for your models and routes using libraries like Mocha and Chai. This helps ensure your application behaves correctly and improves code quality.

### **9. Deployment**

- **Prepare for Deployment**: Before deploying, ensure your app is production-ready. This includes setting environment variables for sensitive information (like database credentials), optimizing performance, and ensuring security measures are in place.
- **Choose a Deployment Platform**: Deploy your backend to a cloud provider like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean. Follow the platform's documentation for deploying Node.js apps.

### **10. Documentation**

- **API Documentation**: Document your API endpoints using tools like Swagger or Postman. This makes it easier for the frontend team to understand how to interact with your API and what data to expect.

By following these steps, Person 2 will be able to set up a robust backend system that supports the functionalities required for your web-based task management system for Ph.D. grades. This backend will authenticate users, manage grade submissions and approvals, send notifications, and serve as the backbone for the frontend application.
